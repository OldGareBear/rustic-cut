                    <p>I've always had an interest in woodworking mostly because of my Dad yet my delve into woodworking really came to fruition after I was severely wounded in Afghanistan.</p> 
                    <p>My wife doesn't know this, but through her loving support and her pushing me to create larger and more complex pieces not only did I become better at woodworking but she also healed me. I found through this odyssey my passion: to create beautiful pieces that make customers smile.</p>
